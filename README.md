## Demo
![placeholder animation](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzlWJtpswtKtVo4w/giphy.gif)

Auto-animating placeholder prompts users to enter a search term and background loops through an array of images every five seconds. [See here](https://github.com/dylankershaw/tagless-frontend/blob/master/src/components/search/search_bar.js) and [here](https://github.com/dylankershaw/tagless-frontend/blob/master/src/components/search/inactive_search_container.js) for code.

<br/>

Placeholder animation disables when search bar is clicked. Search returns all images than have been tagged with a specified keyword (e.g. clouds) and sorts them by their relevancy score.

<br />

![url upload](https://media.giphy.com/media/26CaMGy5EBtCgcDMA/giphy.gif)

Images can be uploaded by entering a third-party URL.

<br />

![file upload](https://media.giphy.com/media/l49JYK801LY9uBTJC/giphy.gif)

Or from a user's computer. Images are auto-tagged on upload in a matter of seconds. [See here](https://github.com/dylankershaw/tagless-backend/blob/master/app/controllers/api/v1/images_controller.rb) for back-end image controller (upload code is in the "create" action).

<br />

Search results are sorted by relevancy score. (e.g. searching for "clouds" displays images very likely to contain clouds at the top and those less likely to contain clouds toward the bottom)

Clicking an image displays all of its labels, sorted by relevancy score. In this example, "dog" appears toward the top with a score of 97% whereas "grass" appears toward the bottom with a score of 53%.

<br />

Labels can be view as bar charts or in a radar chart.
